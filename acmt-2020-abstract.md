Background: Researchers have reacted to the opioid crisis by investigating, among other areas, the most productive way to guide those with opioid use disorder through detoxification, minimize relapses, and restore quality of life. This has led to a proliferation of research that outstrips the ability of researches to synthesize results into a coherent framework or identify tensions between studies. 

Hypothesis: Machine learning can help physicians synthesize novel research more rapidly by generating instructive clinical scenarios and 

Methods: We extracted the abstracts from all NIDA clinical trials related to the treatment of opioid use disorder from X to Y. We manually extracted from each abstract a series of probabilistic logic statements that captured the methods and results. We evaluated the validity of these representations using competency questions. We queried the knowledge base for 10 clinically relevant questions and compared its answers to a panel of board-certified medical toxicologists. A separate group of board-certified medical toxicologist evaluated the plausibility and faithfulness of the algorithm’s instructions.   

Results: We extracted 38 potential study reports from NIDA Clinical Data Share. Of those 38 reports, 15 reports explicitly stated results. From those 15 reports we extracted 161 axiomata, of which 77 axiomata were unique. We extracted 9  3 (median  interquartile range) axiomata from each of the 15 reports. It answered 60/60 competency questions correctly. 

Conclusion: A combination of Bayesian statistics and symbolic logic can represent medical knowledge faithfully and transparently. This representation allows physicians to identify inconsistencies and develop novel insights from the literature by applying medical reasoning to a scale that was not previously possible. Further work is needed to include more researchs works into sudo, and automate the process as well as establishe measurements of validity.
