This is the Primary Outcomes Article for CTN-0017. Protocol CTN-0017, 'HIV and HCV Preventionin Drug Treatment Settings' was a study of 632 drug injectors that tested three interventions to reduce drug and sex risk behaviors.  Participants were randomized to (a) a two-session, HIV/HCV counseling and education (C&amp;E) model added to treatment as usual (TAU), (b) a one-session therapeutic alliance (TA) intervention conducted by outpatient counselors to facilitate treatment entry plus TAU, or (c) TAU.  Significant reductions in drug and sex risk behaviors occurred for all three conditions over a 6-month follow-up period.  C&amp;E participants reported significantly greater rates of attending an HIV testing appointment, but this was not associated with better risk reduction outcomes.  Reporting treatment participation within 2 months after detoxification and self-efficacy to practice safer injection behavior predicted reductions in injection risk behaviors. Conclusions: Findings indicate that participation in detoxification was followed by significant decreases in drug injection and risk behaviors for up to six months; interventions added to standard treatment offered no improvement in risk behavior outcomes.  The study supports the importance of access to detoxification for drug injectors followed by transition to continued treatment.
