This is the Primary Outcomes Article for CTN-0003. The purpose of CTN-0003 was to compare effects of a short or long taper schedule after buprenorphine stabilization on participant outcomes as measured by opioid-free urine tests at the end of each taper period. This multi-site study sponsored by NIDA's National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network was conducted from 2003-2005 to compare two taper conditions (7 days and 28 days). Data were collected at weekly clinic visits through the end of the taper periods, and at 1-month and 3-month post-taper follow-up visits. The intervention involved non-blinded dosing with Suboxone during the 1-month stabilization phase, including three weeks of flexible dosing as determined appropriate by the study physicians. A fixed dose was required for the final week before beginning the taper phase. Measurements included the percentage of participants in each taper group providing urine samples free of illicit opioids at the end of the taper and at follow-up. At the end of the taper, 44% of the 7-day taper group (n=255) provided opioid-free urine speciments compared to 30% of the 28-day taper group (N=261; p=0.0007). There were no differences at the 1- and 3-month follow-up (7 day = 18% and 12%; 28 day = 18% and 13%, for 1 and 3 months, respectively). Conclusions: For individuals terminating buprenorphine pharmacotherapy for opioid dependence, there appears to be no advantage in prolonging the duration of taper.
