This is the Primary Outcomes Paper for CTN-0020. Unemployment is associated with negative outcomes both during and after drug abuse treatment.  Interventions designed to increase rates of employment may also improve drug abuse treatment outcomes.  The purpose of this multi-site clinical trial, protocol CTN-0020, was to evaluate the Job Seekers' Workshop (JSW), a three-session, manualized program designed to train patients in the skills needed to find and secure a job.  Study participants were recruited through the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) from six psychosocial counseling (n=327) and five methadone maintenance (n=301) drug treatment programs.  Participants were randomly assigned to either standard care (program-specific services plus brochure with local employment resources) (SC) or standard care plus JSW.  Three 4-h small group JSW sessions were offered weekly by trained JSW facilitators with ongoing fidelity monitoring.  JSW and SC participants had similar 12- and 24-week results for the primary outcome measure (i.e., obtaining a new taxed job or enrollment in a training program).  Specifically, one-fifth of participants at 12 weeks (20.1-24.3%) and nearly one-third at 24 weeks (31.4-31.9%) had positive outcomes, with 'obtaining a new taxed job' accounting for the majority of cases. Conclusions:Job Seekers' Workshop group participants did not have higher rates of employment/training than standard care controls.  Rates of job acquisition were modest for both groups, suggesting more intensive interventions may be needed.  Alternate targets (e.g., enhancing patient motivation, training in job-specific skills) warrant further study as well.  Secondary analyses of present study findings will examine potential mediators and moderators of study outcomes, with a focus on barriers to employment and other variables.
