#Sudo 

**Purpose** The purpose of **sudo**, the _s_ubstance _u_se _d_isorder _o_ntology is to represent the knowledge from clinical trials on opioid use in a format that both humans and computers can understand. This will allow use to synthesize the results from trials and spot inconsistencies on a larger scale than could be done by hand. We use Markov Logic Networks to represent knowledge. We use the implementation of Markov Logic Networks in [ProbLog](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/problog/index.html), a dialect of prolog.
